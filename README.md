# Maryam_Siddiqui
My name is Maryam Siddiqui, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience. I am a dedicated person with a family of four. I enjoy reading, and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my teaching skills and presentation abilities. I have been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many different personalities and learning styles.The friendliest first encounter you'll ever have with web development. We designed HTML &amp; CSS project that you'll see here. Let's explore  by creating a project and adding a few files to it.
